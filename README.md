# plmc
plmc infers discrete, undirected graphical models using a penalized, maximum pseudolikelihood approach. It can summarize coevolution between residues in biological sequence families (couplingsfile output) or infer the parameters for generative models of sequence families that predict the effects of mutations (paramfile output).

## Usage
      plmc [options] alignmentfile
      plmc -c couplingsfile alignmentfile
      plmc -o paramfile -c couplingsfile alignmentfile
      plmc [-h | --help]
      
    Required input:
      alignmentfile                    Multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format

    Options, output:
      -c  --couplings  couplingsfile   Save coupling scores to file (text)
      -o  --output     paramfile       Save estimated parameters to file (binary)

    Options, alignment processing:
      -s  --scale      <value>         Sequence weights: neighborhood weight [s > 0]
      -t  --theta      <value>         Sequence weights: neighborhood divergence [0 < t < 1]

    Options, Maximum a posteriori estimation (L-BFGS, default):
      -lh --lambdah    <value>         Set L2 lambda for fields (h_i)
      -le --lambdae    <value>         Set L2 lambda for couplings (e_ij)

    Options, general:
      -a  --alphabet   alphabet        Alternative character set to use for analysis
      -f  --focus      identifier      Select only uppercase, non-gapped sites from a focus sequence
      -g  --gapignore                  Model sequence likelihoods only by coding, non-gapped portions
      -m  --maxiter                    Maximum number of iterations
      -n  --ncores    [<number>|max]   Maximum number of threads to use in OpenMP
      -h  --help                       Usage

## Compilation
plm requires no external libraries to compile, but can optionally be accelerated by OpenMP. This repository includes a [C implementation of L-BFGS by Naoaki Okazaki](https://github.com/chokkan/liblbfgs "libLBFGS"). To compile for multicore on OS X, it is necessary to use a GCC instead of clang. Precomplied binaries can be found [here](http://hpc.sourceforge.net/).

**Multicore**. To compile with `gcc` and OpenMP: 

    make all-openmp

**Single core, Linux**. To compile with `gcc`: 

    make all

**Single core, Mac OS X**. To compile with `clang`:

    make all-mac

**Single precision**. All of the above targets compile to double precision (64 bit), but reducing the precision to single (32 bit) increases speed and decreases memory requirements by approximately a factor of two. The fastest compile settings are:

    make all-openmp32

## Examples
**Standard protein alignment**. The following infers a model of the protein dihdyrofolate reductase (DHFR) with regularization parameters 位<sub>e</sub> = 1.0, 位<sub>h</sub> = 1.0 and the maximum number of iterations at 100:

    bin/plmc -o example/DHFR/DHFR.eij -f DYR_ECOLI -le 16.0 -lh 0.01 -m 100 example/DHFR/DHFR.a2m

**Reduced alphabet**. Although the default alphabet is "-ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY", reduced systems can be encoded with arbitrary alphabets. As an example, simulated draws from a 3-state, 1-dimensional Potts model are provided in the examples folder and encoded by the characters _, *, and ^. The following command would estimate the parameters by running to convergence with 位<sub>e</sub> = 1.0, 位<sub>h</sub> = 1.0 and sequence reweighting disabled:

    bin/plmc -c example/potts/potts3.txt -a _*^ -t -1 -le 1.0 -lh 1.0 example/potts/potts3.a2m
A 1D Potts model will only have interactions between i -> i + 1, which should be evident in the coupling summary scores output to example/potts/potts3.txt
